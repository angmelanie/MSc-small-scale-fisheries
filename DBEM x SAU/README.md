# What's in here?

**Purpose:** This folder takes DBEM (from DROBO or cygwin) and on an individual species basis, it calculates magnitude change between years for each cell. Then it applies this magnitude change to the total SAU catch per species in that given EEZ. 

**Result:** SAU catch split according to DBEM proportions  

**Error log:** DBEM do not contain any records within the proposed EEZ
