# Adaptability of small-scale fisheries in PNA to climate changes

...I'm missing a bunch of steps, which I will have to clean the code and push to GitHub.  
I'm creating this GitHub now because my code has gotten ridiculously messy, confusing and I can't find what I need. Also, I'm going back and forth between my mac and PC for running R and I need a way to store my code for easy access. My hopes is this repo will help me organize my analysis and keep me motivated to work and upload my changes! :)

For now, let's jump to Step 7 in my analysis:

| Step | Purpose | Link |
|:------:|:-----:|:---------:|
| 7 | Integrate DBEM future distribution with SAU catch | [Click here](https://github.com/angmelanie/small-scale-fisheries/tree/master/DBEM%20x%20SAU) |
| 8 | There's an error file where DBEM and SAU do not integrate | --|
| 9 | I ignore (for now) the error file, and proceed to average the catch over a 20 year period so that 1990-2060 becomes 2000-2050 to account for inetrannual variability | [Click here](https://github.com/angmelanie/small-scale-fisheries/blob/master/averging%20years.R) |
| 10 | Compare projected catches between EEZ for RCP8.5 and 2.6 | [Click here](https://github.com/angmelanie/small-scale-fisheries/blob/master/catch-by-eez.R) |
| 11 | Compare projected catches between pelagic, demersal | [Click here](https://github.com/angmelanie/small-scale-fisheries/blob/master/catch-by-DemersPelag.R) |
