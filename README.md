# Adaptability of small-scale fisheries in PNA to climate changes

...I'm missing a bunch of steps, which I will have to clean the code and push to GitHub.  
I'm creating this GitHub now because my code has gotten ridiculously messy, confusing and I can't find what I need. Also, I'm going back and forth between my mac and PC for running R and I need a way to store my code for easy access. My hopes is this repo will help me organize my analysis and keep me motivated to work and upload my changes! :)

For now, let's jump to Step 7 in my analysis:
