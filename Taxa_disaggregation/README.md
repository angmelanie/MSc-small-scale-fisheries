## Taxa disaggregation

### What's in here:
-	Canada: **canadalist** - unique species
    +	SSF- everything matches, no error files, all split already [model ACCESS inverts - Ophiodon elongatus] **sau_ssf_canada**
    +	LSF – 29 new categories, split in Excel **sau_lsf_canada3**
    +	TO DO: check how many overlap with existing (CYGWIN, DROBO) and how many to run
-	Alaska **alaskalist**
    +	SSF – no new species, error files exist – only 1 is a direct match [model ACCESS inverts AND remove error species and redistribute] **sau_ssf_alaska**
    +	LSF - no new species [check if species are already in DROBO or CYGWIN]  **sau_lsf_alaska**
-	USA **uslist**
    +	SSF – 36 error species {what to do? A lot direct matches – deleted the G species, others are inverts to model or B/D species with error files but in every case at least RCP2.6 has values} **sau_ssf_us**
    +	LSF -  19 species groupings do not match [check list of split with DROBO and CYGWIN] **sau_lsf_us**
-	Mexico **mexicolist**
    +	SSF – 20 error species (some G species, just redistribute but what about B species? – same issue as US, error files but has numbers think increase catch magnitude) 
** sau_ssf_mexico**
    +	LSF – 39 species groupings do not match [split done, get unique list between SSF and LSF, compare to DROBO and CYGWIN to find out what you need to model still] **View(sau_lsf_mexico)**
